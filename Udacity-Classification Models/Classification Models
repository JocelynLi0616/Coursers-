The Classification Models course provides students with the foundational knowledge to use classification models to create business insights. You will learn:

1. How classification modeling differs from modeling with numeric data
2. To use binary classification models to make predictions of binary outcomes
3. To use non-binary classification models to make predictions of non-binary outcomes

Throughout this course you’ll also learn the techniques to apply your knowledge in a data analytics program called Alteryx. At the end of the course, you’ll complete a project based on the principles in the course.

This course is part of the Business Analyst Nanodegree
